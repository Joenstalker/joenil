        <h1>Introduction to Computing</h1>
        <h5>November 14, 2023</h5>
        <div class="statement">
            <p><b><em>What Is a Computer?</em></b></p>
            <p>In our tech-driven world, daily activities involve computers, whether on a phone, tablet, or any digital device. But what defines a computer?</p>
            <p>A computer is an electronic device executing mathematical and logical operations through programming. Users provide instructions, ranging from basic math to complex logical conditions. Computer programming involves creating a set of instructions for the computer to follow, manipulating data during the process.</p>
            <p>Data, the core of computing, includes information like numbers, words, sentences, or images. Computers store, retrieve, and process this data, offering functionalities like text messaging, email, video streaming, document creation, gaming, and social media interaction.</p>
            <p><b><em>Computer Components</em></b></p>
            <p>Computers consist of hardware and software. Hardware encompasses physical elements, such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, and internal components. Software refers to programs and instructions directing hardware operations.</p>
            <p>Computer Case: Also known as a tower or system unit, it houses internal hardware like storage drives, the motherboard, CPU, and power supply.</p>
            <p>Monitor: An output device displaying information using a graphical user interface (GUI). The monitor reflects the results of computer programs or processes.</p>
            <p>Keyboard: An input device with keys acting as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Users provide input by typing letters, numbers, symbols, and specific computer operations.</p>
            <p>Mouse: A handheld pointing device detecting motion relative to a surface. It allows users to interact with a GUI by moving a pointer on the display.</p>
            <p><b><em>Types of Computers</em></b></p>
            <p>Desktop Computers: Designed for regular use in a fixed location. Components include a case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.</p>
            <p>Laptop Computers: Portable devices with internal hardware, a monitor, keyboard, speakers, and a built-in alternative to a mouse.</p>
            <p>Mobile Devices: Such as smartphones and tablets, feature touchscreens and internal hardware. Touch interaction replaces the need for additional peripherals.</p>
            <p><b><em>Software and Operating Systems</em></b></p>
            <p>Software comprises sets of instructions or programs running on hardware. Operating systems (OS) manage hardware, allocate resources, and provide common services for other software. Windows, macOS, and Linux are common personal computer OS.</p>
            <p><b><em>Programs and Applications</em></b></p>
            <p>Programs are sets of instructions for specific tasks, while applications (or apps) are user-focused programs providing connected tasks and functions. Both are examples of software, with apps running within the context of other software.</p>            
            <p><b><em>Typing and Case-Sensitivity</em></b></p>
            <p>Typing is a fundamental skill, and touch typing involves typing without looking at the keyboard. The QWERTY keyboard is a common design used for typing. Case-sensitivity in computers refers to how uppercase and lowercase letters are treated, affecting tasks like searching, usernames, passwords, file names, and variable names in programming.</p>
            <p><b><em>Mouse Functionality</em></b></p>
            <p>A mouse, a pointing input device, has buttons for left-clicking, right-clicking, and a scroll wheel for navigation. It allows users to interact with a GUI, providing functions like rollover, click, double-click, and drag-and-drop.</p>
            <p><b><em>Conclusion</em></b></p>
            <p>Mastering these fundamentals is key for effective communication in our computer-centric world. Whether you're a novice or brushing up on basics, having the right terminology is crucial for effective interaction in various contexts involving computers.</p>
