        <p>This happened on 2018-2019 at Casisang Senior Higt School (Standalone)<br>
           I was an electrcian at the building A after finishing my training at TESDA held in Barangay Casisang.<br>
           That was an starting point of my life to work with your own skills to be able to gain more experience for future reference.<br>
           Months pass, I am very proud that I was able to finish my work experience there and gain alot of knowledge to the point that until today I can still make it as my asset.

        <p>Last year, 2022 when I was ask favor from my friend to assist him on installing CCTV in their shop.<br>
            So, it was a good timing that I am available that day. I did assist him and apply my skills as Electrician in term of set up for wiring.<br>
            Little did I know, I am having fun seeing that all cameras working and display the expected output of the work.<br>
            To make a long story short, as BSIT student, I am also working at Yoona Computer Trading as part-time Technician.<br>

        <p> When I enter the technology industry, I began to get more interested going back to college. When I also heared the Bukindon State Unversity <br>
            is a free tuition school, I do my best to pass the entrance exam which I did passed. My first choice is BSIT where I am right now as First Year student.<br>
            I did not expect as soon as now that we are about to create our own website as Final Project for the first semester of the year 2023. <br>
            This is really amazing for me because I am gaining the knowledge and ability to create Website. This experience might not be applicable for now as student <br>
            but surely it will never be move as long as I am continuously learning on it. WebDev is career that I am aiming in the future.
